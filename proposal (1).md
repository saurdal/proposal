# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Baldur's Gate 3 Armory

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive website that showcases the Baldur's Gate 3 Armor/Clothing options, allowing users to browse through all the armor and see each of their customization options.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will follow the same structure as an online clothing store without a "checkout" feature. Users will be able to filter through the wearable items based on category. Each item will feature a picture and title. When each item is clicked on, users can view the different color customizations available for that specific item. This website will be made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the structure, style, and interactivisty of the page. Python and flask will be used to manage filtering and connect to a database with the item details.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website that sorts the wearable Baldur's Gate 3 items by category, allowing the user to browse through and see the photos and titles of each of the items.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website sorts the items by category, allowing the user to browse through and see the photos and titles of each items and when clicked on, each item is able to be previewed on it's own page with any of the cuztomization options (clothing dye).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website sorts the items by category, allowing the user to browse through and see the photos and titles of each items and when clicked on, each item is able to be previewed on it's own page with any of the cuztomization options (clothing dye), as well as favorited by the user or saved.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to do more research about Flask and how I can use it to connect a database to my website. I also need to expand my knowledge on how to combine these languages together to run a functioning website. I will also start building the foundation of the page with my prior knowledge and see where I run into issues with HTML/CSS and Javascript (things I don't know or need to learn more about). My two biggest blindspots will be with the integration of the languages and database management so I will be doing most of my research and learning on these topics.
